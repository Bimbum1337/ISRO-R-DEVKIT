# Silkroad Online Development Kit

SRO_DevKit is a C++ framework for the game *Silkroad Online*. It offers different interfaces to interact with 
components of the game. The framework is designed to be binary compatible to the original game client allowing the 
entire codebase to work without raw assembly code.

The framework was initially created to assist analyzing the game, but it can also be used to develop extensions.
