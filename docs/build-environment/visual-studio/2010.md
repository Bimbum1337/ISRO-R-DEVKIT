# Setup Visual Studio 2010

Visual Studio 2010 is the recommended development tool. It has been tested 
extensively and works without any problems.

## Setup

1. Follow [this guide](../cmake.md) and install CMake.
2. Follow [this guide](2005.md) and install Visual Studio 2005.

After these, install any Visual Studio 2010 you can find (probably not an 
Express version, these are no fun to work with).

After, and **ONLY** after installing Visual Studio 2010, install:

* Follow [this guide](../daffodil.md) to install Daffodil.

## Project generation

Double click on the `make_project_vs2010.cmd` file.

```
%VS80COMNTOOLS%\vsvars.bat

cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 2010" -T v80 ../path/to/project_root
```
