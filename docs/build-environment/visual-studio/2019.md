# Setup Visual Studio 2019

!!! info
    Visual Studio 2019 finally introduces a feature, which absence Microsoft used 
    to milk money from their customers: [Native Multi-Targeting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/use-native-multi-targeting?view=vs-2019)
    
    Native Multi-Targeting allows you to use other compilers than the one shipped with 
    Visual Studio 2019. For whatever reason, Visual C++ 8.0 (the compiler of Visual 
    Studio 2005), is not supported.
    
    It is also not compatible with Daffodil.
    
    Visual Studio 2019 can deal with Visual Studio 2010 project files, so we can work with that.
    
## Setup

1. Follow [this guide](2010.md) to install CMake, Visual Studio 2005, Visual Studio 2010 and Daffodil.
2. Install Visual Studio 2019 with C++ support.

## Project generation

!!! danger 
    Visual Studio 2019 comes with CMake. The integration is crooked and can not be used for SRO_DevKit. Therefore we can 
    not use it. We need to generate the project on our own.

Double click on the `make_project_vs2010.cmd` file.

!!! info
    Yes! This will generate a Visual Studio 2010 project. We can still open it in Visual Studio 2019.
