# Contributing

Are you interested in contributing to SRO_DevKit? Want to report a bug or 
propose a feature? Please read through the following guidelines carefully.

## Submission context

### Got a question or a problem?

There's no need to open an issue for a quick question or if you're just 
looking for general guidance. You can ask your questions on our Discord Server:

[https://discord.gg/7zutsb](https://discord.gg/7zutsb)

### Found a bug?

That's great. Please report all bugs you encounter by submitting an issue to
the [issue tracker on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/florian0/sro_devkit/-/issues).
You can directly submit a pull request if you are able to fix the bug yourself.
That would be really great.

### Missing a feature?

We're lacking a lot of features, for sure. We'd love to hear what you would 
like to see in upcommong versions. Please request new features through the 
issue tracker on GitLab. You're allowed to remove the predefined text as it is 
only suitable for bugreports.

If you would like to contribute a new feature, please open an issue in the 
issue tracker first to be sure it is of use for everyone and meets the goals of
this project. Please also consider what kind of change it is:

* In case of a *major* feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
it can be discussed. This allows better coordination and feedback to prevent 
duplication of work and easier integration into the project after completion.

* If your change is only a *small* change, you might just make a merge request.
However there is no guarantee that your proposal will be accepted. Good 
communication beforehand make it more likely.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/florian0/sro_devkit/-/issues). Maybe your issue 
was already reported and, at best, there is a workaround available.

If you happen to find a similar issue, check if you can contribute more 
information to help getting it resolved. If you just want to express your 
interest in getting this issue being addressed sooner, click the 
"Thumbs Up"-reaction-button.

If you create a new issue, you'll notice that the description field is filled 
with a template. Please fill in your information accordingly. Be as precise as
needed to describe your matter. Include screenshots as well as complete error 
messages, if reasonable.

### Submitting a merge request (MR)

A merge request is a way to merge changes done to your own copy of SRO_DevKit
into the main repository. This is a great and easy mechanism to integrate your
changes into our code.


!!! warning "Regarding contribution via issues, mail and Discord"

    Please don't contribute code through issues, mail or Discord. These are not 
    suitable for contributing code. Please only use a merge request.

    
Before you start working on a merge request, have a look existing [merge 
requests](https://gitlab.com/florian0/sro_devkit/-/merge_requests). You don't 
want start working on a topic only to later on notice somebody has been working
on the same aswell.

Once you start developing, make a fork of the project. Create a new branch in 
your fork where you commit your changes to.
